# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my exercises and solutions as I work through various books to learn C programming. I'm actively studying the language to gain a deeper understanding and improve my skills.

## Books I'm Working With
Iâ€™m solving problems and practicing exercises from the following books:

1. **C Programming Language - 2nd Edition (OCR)**  
   A classic text by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, widely considered the go-to resource for learning C programming.

2. **C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)**  
   A comprehensive book by K. N. King that covers C programming concepts with a modern approach.

3. **Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming**  
   A book by Robert C. Seacord that helps solidify practical and professional C programming techniques.

## Current Progress
I'm currently working through **Chapter 5**: *Pointers* from "C Programming Language - 2nd Edition (OCR)" and am in the final section of the chapter.
